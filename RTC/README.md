# RTC Repo For Research-Related Stuff

RTC_DataExtraction_Mapping word doc: 
Contains detailed steps followed for RTC data extraction and mapping.

Extraction_Scripts:
All plain-java API code which was used to extract data from RTC.

Python_Scripts:
1.Contains scripts needed to scrape data from the XML output generated by the REST API for extracting DOORS test cases and test scripts. 
2.Also contains the scripts for aggragating the source files based on package names needed to apply classfication models using Weka.
3.Also contains scripts to train word embeddings from RTC corpus.

RTC.R: 
This script connects to the MySQL RTC database and fetches all the required work items and test case data. 

RTC_Data_Selection.R: 
This script normalizes the text in test cases and converts the source code file names into the required   format. Also splits the final trace generated by Generate_Trace.R into train, test and validation sets and saves then into rds files.

Generate_Trace.R: 
This script generates a mxn trace matrix withlinked itesm and non-linked items equal to 10 times the number of linked items.

Trace:
This is the project folder which contains the Lua Torch code for RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU and Bi-GRU models.
